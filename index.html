            <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>This is a website to lookup games without age rate for Steam, built on GitHub pages </p>

            <h3>Are unrated games a problem?</h3>
            <p>Because of a new regulation in Germany, all games without an age rating are no longer allowed to be sold in
                Germany</p>

            <h3>So, this includes which games exactly?</h3>
            <p>Sadly, this will include all games without an age rating</p>

            <h3>Isn't age rating via official organizations either slow or costly?</h3>
            <p>This does not matter because steam itself provides a solution that is free and can be done via a form on
                the steam partner page </p>

            <h3>When will this be a problem?</h3>
            <p>On <b>November 15th</b> all games without an age rating will be delisted from the Steam Store in Germany
            </p>

            <h3>What about games I've already bought?</h3>
            <p>If you purchased a game and it does not have an age rating, you don't have to worry and you can still
                play the game after the deadline</p>

            <h3>Can newer games be uploaded without age rating?</h3>
            <p>No. As of right now, the upload process for Steam requires age verification</p>

            <h3>What can I do if found a game which is not rated?</h3>
            <p>First off, you should double-check the official Steam Store page for the game to ensure that the data of
                this site is not outdated</p>
            <p>If it seems that there is no rating, then you can only rely on the game's developer to initialize the
                rating process</p>
            <p>Please do not pressure developers who don't already have or do not want to rate their games</p>

            <h3>For more info, lookup the official statement and FAQ from steam</h3>
            <p>Statement: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4678768276768588864</p>
            <p>FAQ: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey/germany</p>

            <h3>Personal thoughts:</h3>
            <p>It's quite sad that many games will be delisted because of this</p>
            <p>The preferred solution should be that every unlisted game should be listed as 18+ if no rating has been
                given</p>
            <p>However, this idea has already been rejected by the government</p>
            <p>This affects mainly games from smaller studios, which no longer maintain or are sometimes unable to
                update games due to various reasons</p>
            <p>In the end, this results in some great indie games that can no longer be purchased</p>
            <p>Don't be discouraged or enraged because some games will be unlisted</p>
            <p>There's always the possibility for Steam or Germany to handle this situation differently in the future, so that
                we can buy unrated games again</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading this!</p>
